This is a project to manage book loans, but still on early stages of development.

In each folder, there's a READ.ME file, with some of the TO DO tasks. If you could help us and take some of them, 
would be really helpful =). 
No need to hurry though, as we're not expecting for you to complete all these tasks.
Take the ones you're more confortable with, and feel free to ask any questions, install a package you think is useful
or search on the web (not on ChatGPT, though =().

If you really understand about Sequelize, data modeling and Unit Tests (using mocha and supertest), 
we would ask you to go a step ahead and create our loan functionality. That would include:
    - Model 
    - Relationship
    - Repository
    - Module
    - Endpoint
    - Tests

But again, no hurries... whatever you finish, will be taken into consideration.

Just remember, before start working, create a new branch named 'name_surname'.

Thanks again!
